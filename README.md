Math:
1. Orders of operation. what is the priority?
(9+2)*4
2. About division:  18/4 = 4.5 18//4=4(drops off the fractional part)
3. calculate the powers:5**3 


Scala Objects:
int 
float
bool
Nonetype - special, has one value, None
Can use type to see the type of an object

Variable:
1.tuna = 5
  20+tuna
  25
2. all math operation rules apply plus reassignment

Strings:
1. back-slash to avoid confusion \’
2. \n- go to a new line
3. what if I want to print out  print(‘C:\des\newline’) as a whole line?
Revise it as print(r‘C:\des\newline’) – r means rush string
4. print out strings in multiple times 
first = Yuqian
first*5
also works in printing function print(first*5)
5. Take string as an array: always starts at position 0
full=’Yuqian zhang’
full[0]=’Y’ regular counting from left to right
counting from right to left by usig-1  full[-1]=’g’
substring function full[2:7] left position included, right not
if just leave it like full[:7] prints from the beginning until 7th position
likewise full[2:] prints from the character on position 2 to the end 
[:]prints the whole string
6. len function prints the length of the string
len(full) gives the answer of 12
